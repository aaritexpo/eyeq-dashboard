1013,2025-11-11 13:51:29.268,826,"Noted that even with the brightness turned up all the way the glasses display was hard to see on light backgrounds. Found themselves looking down at the dark table and straight at the black tv instead of at the light walls or light furniture"
1013,2025-11-11 13:52:25.383,882,"Noted that the glasses are starting to feel heavy on the bridge of their nose. Not to the point where they need to take them off but uncomfortable enough to notice"
1013,2025-11-11 13:55:27.461,1064,"Wished they could zoom in on the content. Too far away"
1013,2025-11-11 13:56:47.901,1144,"Noted it would be nice to be able to move the screen to the left lens instead of the right"
1013,2025-11-11 14:25:07.880,2844,"Reels was not interactive enough and the pt said they were more conscious of the heaviness of the glasses and felt tired. Compared to building legos before"
