3007,2026-01-08 10:50:16.996,338,"Hey Meta struggled to catch a name that is more unique, user had to change the WhatsApp contact name to a nickname so that Meta could send the media."

3007,2026-01-08 10:58:24.541,825,"“Feels like meta is more with you than the other glasses probably because it has less to process”"
3007,2026-01-08 10:58:55.087,856,"User leans in very closely to items when taking a picture."
3007,2026-01-08 11:01:34.044,1015,"Glasses take photos in a .5x lens similar to the other glasses “which is good because it gets more”."
3007,2026-01-08 11:03:56.444,1157,"User is using the phone to check the quality of the photos being taken and sent."

3007,2026-01-08 11:07:47.070,1388,"User took a video of a movie that has a photo changing holographic case, camera captured it well. User compared it to when a photo is taken of a computer screen and it shows “waves and lines”"

3007,2026-01-08 11:13:03.019,1704,"It works well asking meta to do 2 tasks in one command. Faster than the other glasses did."
3007,2026-01-08 11:14:06.136,1767,"User told glasses to take a 3 second video, glasses were unable to do that. User started over by asking it to take a video without time limit."

3007,2026-01-08 11:19:34.778,2095,"User is used to Hey Meta not hearing commands, finds it surprising that these glasses do hear the command on the first try."
3007,2026-01-08 11:23:29.455,2330,"These glasses talk to user a lot and only sometimes silences when it senses user speaking. Sometimes it continues talking while user is trying to engage in outside conversation."

3007,2026-01-08 11:34:00.584,2961,"“These glasses give something rather than nothing, that’s the experience today with the Ai. Last glasses wouldn’t respond if it couldn’t give an answer, these ones will say it cannot complete the action, give a reason and provide a resource.”"
3007,2026-01-08 11:43:48.015,3549,"“The glasses speaks a little bit faster than the other glasses, which isn’t necessary. I believe they should speak at the same pace, regardless of how long the answer is.”"

3007,2026-01-08 12:13:32.788,5333,"“This task was pretty easy but a little hiccups. You need to know the terminology that meta will understand in order to get it to do what you want. Once you know it, it gets easier to work with”"
