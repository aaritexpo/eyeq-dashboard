3007,2026-01-07 10:53:34.103,333,"Can see the display on the glasses well. User seemed confused and stumped for a second but when asked said there were no problems or issues."

3007,2026-01-07 10:58:07.055,606,"User took photos of each scavenger hunt photo and sent them using “hey meta” command."
3007,2026-01-07 11:02:49.667,889,"User asks Meta Ai about the surrounding artwork. Meta Ai couldn’t answer. User turned off camera using gesture controls to see if that would help and it did."
3007,2026-01-07 11:03:26.755,926,"User believes that the answers are correct and relevant."
3007,2026-01-07 11:05:25.761,1045,"Meta Ai gave a different answer about the same starry night paintings but with different levels of contrast. Called one “starry night painting” and the other “a painting based off of starry night”. User found this interesting that it could distinguish the 2 paintings differently."
3007,2026-01-07 11:08:29.427,1228,"User says they “broke the Ai” by asking it about a historical figure. It said “here is what I generated “ but gave no answer."
3007,2026-01-07 11:09:47.383,1306,"Meta Ai doesn’t want to switch topics, user asks about a new item they are looking at and meta Ai continues to expand on previous answers."
3007,2026-01-07 11:13:06.443,1505,"User did a test question and meta Ai answered “half correctly “ according to participant."
3007,2026-01-07 11:16:18.524,1698,"User says visibility of the display is fine but feels the need to turn head towards the display to view it dead on but cannot, as the display also moves. User prefers to have the display in the middle of the eyes, slightly larger."
3007,2026-01-07 11:18:56.401,1855,"User interrupted Ai, then when asking Ai to continue Ai responded by playing music on Spotify. User found this amusing."
3007,2026-01-07 11:21:40.891,2020,"User asked Ai to name the desert in an image, it responded that there were no desserts in the image but it looks to be a desert landscape. User rephrased question to get a better answer but found previous answer amusing."
3007,2026-01-07 11:23:53.909,2153,"User says the glasses ability to “see” what the user is seeing is slightly off. It catches the peripheral rather than what is center of the user’s vision."
3007,2026-01-07 11:25:13.731,2233,"User says the glasses view the world in a way that is expanded peripherally, like a camera with its setting on .5x. User has to get really close to an object to get the glasses to catch the correct item the user is asking about."
3007,2026-01-07 11:28:08.566,2408,"User says they would use the ask meta feature often in everyday life. “I would ask it a lot of questions about things I pass by” ex. What type of plant is this?"

3007,2026-01-07 12:24:12.464,5771,"“The ability to see and work at the same time is easy, easier than using a phone. It is easy to read instructions while building with my hands.”"
3007,2026-01-07 12:25:17.691,5837,"“Reading blueprints, working on instruction based tasks would be great for it. Anything where you need constant reference to data without having to switch back and forth.”"
