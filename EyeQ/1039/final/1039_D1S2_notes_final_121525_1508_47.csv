1039,2025-12-15 13:20:39.282,1004,"Notes that audio is surprisingly good. However, when she takes a picture of small text it is hard to see in the photo, but may be easier to see on a phone."
1039,2025-12-15 13:21:19.148,1044,"Likes that the display can go away after you take a picture. Also notes that it can be creepy if someone doesn’t know pictures are being taken."

1039,2025-12-15 13:54:32.648,3037,"Participant asks for book recommendations while looking at bookshelf. Noted that after asking a few times, Meta gives recommendations of books that do not exist on the shelf but have similar names to books on the shelf."
1039,2025-12-15 13:57:33.216,3218,"Participant notes that Meta won’t answer questions about product or pricing information, like “where is this tag from” but if you ask it leading questions like “is the tag from Goodwill” it will answer yes."
1039,2025-12-15 14:01:13.810,3438,"Participant states the scrolling gets stuck on the thumbs up and thumbs down icons when she’s trying to read through text and makes it hard to read it all when Meta provides her an answer."

1039,2025-12-15 14:15:57.843,4322,"Participant states she has to talk fast when sending a voice message. If she takes too long of a pause it seems to clear the words that she said before the pause. Also, it added a period when she took a pause later in the message."
1039,2025-12-15 14:16:58.223,4383,"States dictation is kind of nice except that you do have to know exactly what you’re going to say and not take pauses. Also notes that it adds your “extra umms and uhhs”."
1039,2025-12-15 14:18:48.385,4493,"Participant is not receiving WhatsApp notifications or message readouts from WhatsApp. This setting is turned on in Meta AI app. However, moderator checked iPhone Settings and saw that notifications were off for WhatsApp. Toggled these notifications on."

1039,2025-12-15 14:23:15.213,4760,"Participant notes it feels like Black Mirror because there is an episode where people have contacts that allow them to see things in their visual field.

1039,2025-12-15 14:59:37.993,6942,"Participant notes that you can’t research fully on this device because it gives small snippets. For example, it will give specific venues and a map when asked about wedding venues, but she would still have to research further on the internet."
1039,2025-12-15 15:01:08.400,7033,"Participant moves head to one side when trying to see something towards that edge of the display."
