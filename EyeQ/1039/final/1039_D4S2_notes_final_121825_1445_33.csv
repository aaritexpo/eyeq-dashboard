1039,2025-12-18 12:45:08.660,156,"Participant starts session on the light green couch, but moves around the room to take pictures and images."
1039,2025-12-18 12:48:18.407,346,"Participant states these glasses are very simple to use, picks up her prompts well, thinks the ability to take photos is the best thing about both the newer and older glasses. Also notes that the quality of photos is really good."
1039,2025-12-18 12:49:33.026,421,"Participant notes she is not able to zoom on these glasses."
1039,2025-12-18 12:50:13.119,461,"Participant notes that when she takes photos on these glasses, there is more background than she expected. It’s like the glasses are more zoomed out than what her actual eyes see."
1039,2025-12-18 12:50:46.075,494,"Participant attempted to prompt meta to zoom in, but does not believe that the device has this capability."
1039,2025-12-18 12:55:38.248,786,"Participant checks gallery to see recent photos and videos on the iPhone."
1039,2025-12-18 12:58:24.292,952,"Participant had trouble ending video. She thinks this is likely because Meta only responds to “hey Meta end video”, not “Meta end video”."
1039,2025-12-18 13:00:22.514,1070,"Participant feels like the audio isn’t as good on these glasses. Feels like it sounds a bit fuzzier."
1039,2025-12-18 13:01:20.584,1128,"Also feels like the video is a little distorted in that it makes her look taller. Explains that this is probably because the top of the video starts at a place taller than her eyes."
1039,2025-12-18 13:01:55.150,1163,"Participant was able to take a picture of the floor with her hands behind her back without the glasses sliding down."
1039,2025-12-18 13:05:22.713,1370,"Participant verbally prompted Meta to change volume."
1039,2025-12-18 13:08:12.909,1540,"Participant took an accidental photo while looking at the ground. She was in the process of trying to send another photo while this happened. Meta asked her if she wanted to send ground photo, she said no, but it sent ground photo anyway. She had taken another photo after ground photo and was trying to send that."
1039,2025-12-18 13:09:20.874,1608,"Participant states it’s impossible to give a command like “take a photo and send to xyz” because as soon as she says the word “photo” it takes a picture and interrupts the flow of the prompt."
1039,2025-12-18 13:10:58.333,1706,"Participant took pictures of book text of different sizes, then viewed the photos on phone. Noted that big text was easy to see, but could not see the details of smaller text even when zooming in on the phone. States her phone would have been able to show clear small text when zoomed in."
1039,2025-12-18 13:14:01.910,1889,"Participant states asking questions is convenient for quick things."
1039,2025-12-18 13:34:34.322,3122,"Participant moved to grey couch at 30 minute mark."
1039,2025-12-18 13:43:40.287,3668,"Participant states now that she’s using the glasses without a display, it feels like the screen is useful. Wishes she could navigate to Spotify through the screen."
1039,2025-12-18 13:48:30.696,3958,"Participant notes the music quality on Spotify is pretty good. When she receives or sends a message on WhatsApp, Spotify will pause the music and then will unpause soon after sending the message."
1039,2025-12-18 13:49:32.565,4020,"Participant thinks glasses got stuck. Spotify is playing in the background but there is also the ringtone noise that denotes that something is loading."
1039,2025-12-18 13:50:42.701,4090,"States Meta is “struggling a little bit” as she tries to send message to moderator on WhatsApp. States it plays the ringtone loading or reconnecting noise and then closes out."
1039,2025-12-18 13:51:07.777,4115,"After a few attempts participant was able to dictate and send a message on WhatsApp."
1039,2025-12-18 13:57:12.371,4480,"Participant thinks the voice to text on this device is preferable to voice to text on the newer glasses. States that it doesn’t pick up every “um” and “uh” that she says. Additionally, it doesn’t clear everything she had previously said when she pauses. Also, it reads the messages back to her."
1039,2025-12-18 14:02:36.317,4804,"Participant switched to dark green chair at 60 minutes."
1039,2025-12-18 14:07:40.388,5108,"Participant notes that she saw a message notification pop up on the iPhone but never got an audio notification or readout from the glasses. Participant waited about a minute and then checked the phone in order to see and answer the text message."
1039,2025-12-18 14:12:33.790,5401,"Participant feels like having a whole conversation through the glasses is kind of tiring because she has to prompt it every time. Would rather pick up her phone and send it and be done."
1039,2025-12-18 14:13:31.477,5459,"Participant also notes that she has to know what she’s going to say before starting the conversation when texting using the glasses."
1039,2025-12-18 14:14:28.066,5516,"Participant moved to light green chair."
1039,2025-12-18 14:19:15.336,5803,"Participant notes that if she asks for directions to a specific location, Meta will send those directions to her phone."
1039,2025-12-18 14:34:21.684,6709,"Participant notes that when she asked how long Boeing astronauts were stuck in space, Meta gave an answer using odd tenses. Meta stated that the astronauts are expected to come back by February 2025 (in a way that suggested that date had not passed yet). Participant asked the question in a simpler way (“how long were the Boeing astronauts stuck in space”) and Meta gave a more normal answer of 9 months."
1039,2025-12-18 14:40:31.042,7079,"Participant states glasses today are nice, still a bit bulky. Likes the concept that it’s basically headphones. States AirPods can do the same thing except taking photo and video. So these glasses are mainly for photos, videos, and asking directions."
1039,2025-12-18 14:40:52.720,7100,"Participant wishes display on newer generation glasses was less transparent and easier to see."
1039,2025-12-18 14:41:32.120,7140,"Participant feels a pokey feeling behind the ears, only after wearing them for a while, didn’t feel it earlier in the day."
1039,2025-12-18 14:41:50.635,7158,"Participant felt like she was straining her eye and cross -eyeing to do legos and reels."
