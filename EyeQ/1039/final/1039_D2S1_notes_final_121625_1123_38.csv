1039,2025-12-16 09:23:36.421,271,"After finding and sending first picture on WhatsApp, participant states that the process is “pretty smooth”."
1039,2025-12-16 09:25:08.943,364,"Participant states it is nice that these are transition lenses, she did not realize at first until moderator pointed it out. States that it’s nice that the sun is not in her eyes."
1039,2025-12-16 09:26:31.165,446,"On the third picture, Meta had trouble understanding participant’s verbal prompt to send picture on WhatsApp. Used hand gestures instead and was able to send image without issue."
1039,2025-12-16 09:28:44.471,579,"Participant used neural band finger gestures to send next image. States that the voice commands are nice when they work but both voice and finger gestures are pretty smooth options."
1039,2025-12-16 09:30:34.606,689,"Participant sent next image using finger gestures, states that it’s nice that the moderator’s contact was already suggested since she had texted her last."
1039,2025-12-16 09:38:05.732,1140,"Participant prefers to view display by looking at a shaded spot on the wall. States that when she looks at a spot on the wall that is covered in sunlight, it’s really hard to see the display."

1039,2025-12-16 09:41:14.053,1329,"Participant states that the only good spots to view the display are the shady spots on the wall or the turf on the ground, but when she looks towards the ground the glasses start to slide off her face."

1039,2025-12-16 09:44:24.666,1519,"She took a video but when trying to view it, she could only hear the sounds and not see any movement from the video thumbnail."
1039,2025-12-16 09:46:00.105,1615,"Participant feels like she can feel the vibration of the neural band more today. Feels like there is no change in how well it picks up her hand gestures."
1039,2025-12-16 09:48:43.145,1778,"Participant states it was easy and clear to see words on the screen, especially in the shade."
1039,2025-12-16 09:53:13.369,2048,"Participant notes that current version of glasses are pretty big and bulky, states she would be interested in buying them in a few generations when they are smaller and feel more fitted to her face."
1039,2025-12-16 09:54:55.855,2151,"Feels like she tightened neural band a bit more than yesterday and for that reason it is a bit more responsive to her movements."
1039,2025-12-16 09:57:26.207,2301,"Participant feels like even with the transition lenses, the sun is bright."
1039,2025-12-16 10:01:31.449,2546,"Yesterday participant noted that when she used the zoom and then stopped the gesture, it zoomed out immediately. Today, she states it stays zoomed in. Believes this is due to having neural band a bit tighter."

1039,2025-12-16 10:14:23.597,3318,"When in the sun facing a poster with white coloring, it is impossible for participant to see the display."
1039,2025-12-16 10:15:10.187,3365,"When facing towards the wall, participant faces her shadow to see display."
1039,2025-12-16 10:22:07.428,3782,"Participant states if she closes her left eye it’s a lot easier to see the display. However, she is trying to to keep both eyes open."

1039,2025-12-16 10:24:19.535,3914,"Participant feels that there is some glare from the sun. Moved to the other side of the table but still finds it hard to see the images in the display. Also notes that as she is looking down towards the black table in order to see the images more clearly, the glasses slide down her nose."
1039,2025-12-16 10:28:43.115,4178,"Covered the tables with green tablecloth and participant states that this improved her ability to see images somewhat."
1039,2025-12-16 10:30:15.799,4271,"Participant is trying to figure out if it is the same color as the images or different colors."
1039,2025-12-16 10:31:53.421,4368,"Participant states this section is a little bit more difficult than she was anticipating with the glasses sliding down her face when she looks down and the images being somewhat unclear."
1039,2025-12-16 10:34:00.959,4496,"Participant states normally she really likes legos. She states “just write high key struggling, can’t see nothing”."
1039,2025-12-16 10:34:43.057,4538,"Participant states maybe indoors this would be a little different, but maybe it’s the sun that makes task harder."
1039,2025-12-16 10:35:57.903,4613,"Participant is holding glasses on the left side by the arm to keep them in place as she looks down."
1039,2025-12-16 10:40:21.098,4876,"Participant briefly got up and moved to another table to see if she would be better able to see the display at that location. Decided to stay at current table."
1039,2025-12-16 10:41:50.987,4966,"States that in the images on the display it almost looks like there’s a black colored piece, but there is definitely no black piece in the physical set of legos."
1039,2025-12-16 10:43:21.508,5056,"At times participant uses her hand to shade her face from the sun in order to better view the display. She holds hand above glasses in a salute-type motion."
1039,2025-12-16 10:53:38.495,5673,"Participant notes three main obstacles. First, the display is very translucent in an outdoor setting. Second, the glasses slide down her nose when she looks down, and she must look down at the table or ground to see the display as clearly as possible. Third, the display times out frequently and she has to re-open the pictures."
1039,2025-12-16 10:57:45.142,5920,"Participant states glasses notified her with a tone that glasses battery is at 14%."
1039,2025-12-16 11:04:28.570,6323,"Participant has moved on to the second Lego task. She feels like the colors for the second task better match the physical legos."
