1039,2025-12-17 09:17:46.123,90,"Participant starts session in the dark green chair."
1039,2025-12-17 09:18:18.977,123,"Feels like display is very translucent with a glare. Adjusted brightness up and stated that adjusting brightness helped a bit but not a ton."
1039,2025-12-17 09:22:05.862,350,"Participant sits angled towards the right, facing the grey couch with face angled slightly downward to watch reels."
1039,2025-12-17 09:37:50.282,1294,"Participant feels like experience watching reels is pretty similar to watching reels in the car. Notes that it is annoying because there are glare spots around the play buttons and around all the white buttons on the display. The display is very see through even when brightness is all the way up, has to focus to actually see what she’s trying to see. However, the quality of the videos is good."
1039,2025-12-17 09:38:05.641,1310,"Participant moved to grey couch."
1039,2025-12-17 09:40:40.636,1465,"Participant states it is much easier to watch reels on the phone because the phone is much easier to focus on. When she was on the green couch she was focusing eyes on the side of the grey couch as a background, but notes there is still “a lot going on” when focusing on that background."
1039,2025-12-17 09:58:06.148,2510,"Participant has switched to light green chair."
1039,2025-12-17 10:05:11.499,2935,"Participant states that the bright lights cause a glare on the glasses. It makes the display translucent and makes the experience less comfortable. Makes it harder to focus on watching videos."
1039,2025-12-17 10:06:44.849,3029,"Participant picked up a piece of paper to hold in front of her in order to use as a background but stated she would need a dark background and put the paper down shortly after."
1039,2025-12-17 10:08:20.266,3124,"Instagram froze and stopped loading reels. Participant closed and reopened app, then noted that reels are still not loading. Participant toggled glasses switch off and back on, noted that Instagram was still struggling. Toggled glasses off and on again, and then noted that the app began to work normally."
1039,2025-12-17 10:10:02.665,3227,"Participant feels like “the glasses are just not made for reels”. States “you have to have the perfect background or else” reels are hard to see. States it is probably better for your posture because you don’t have to look down like you would if you were using your phone."
1039,2025-12-17 10:21:02.392,3886,"Participant feels like the finger gestures are pretty intuitive. Recalls that for the first hour she wore the neural band, it felt like she had to figure it out."
1039,2025-12-17 10:25:33.134,4157,"Participant also feels like it helps to have the neural band pretty tight. Forgets that it’s there until she takes it off and can see the marks on her wrist. However, it is not too tight. Notes that if it’s too loose, it doesn’t pick up gestures."
1039,2025-12-17 10:36:24.570,4809,"Participant switched to grey couch."
1039,2025-12-17 10:38:26.399,4930,"Participant likes the audio of the glasses because it sounds the same as wearing earbuds. She would consider that a pro of the device. The con would be the translucent display. Participant notes the audio is similar to wearing over the ear earbuds."
1039,2025-12-17 10:40:21.145,5045,"Participant notes that in Instagram reels on the phone, you could go to the search bar and search for reels of a particular topic if you wanted to. However, when watching reels on the glasses display, the only option is to watch the reels chosen by the for you page."
1039,2025-12-17 10:41:56.318,5140,"Participant also notes that if you prolong the “select” gesture while in reels, it clears the display such that only the video is visible and there is no text on the screen. Participant likes this feature but notes that it wasn’t covered in the tutorial and she had to play around with it to figure that out."
1039,2025-12-17 10:45:30.346,5354,"Participant notes she finds herself not blinking and then her eyes start getting watery. Also notes that this happens sometimes in her day to day life so it may not be an effect of the glasses."
1039,2025-12-17 10:57:19.950,6064,"Participant moved to light green chair."
1039,2025-12-17 11:10:27.595,6852,"When comparing experience indoors vs outdoors, participant notes neither is her favorite and she prefers the phone screen. Feels like outside there is glare especially when sun was really bright, inside there’s a light form of glare but it’s hard to see the videos because of the transparency. You see the books and other items in the background."
