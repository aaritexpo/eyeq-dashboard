1039,2025-12-18 09:25:25.845,336,"Participant starts session on light green couch."
1039,2025-12-18 09:28:23.586,514,"Participant had trouble sending the first message on WhatsApp. Participant said moderator’s name incorrectly when promoting meta to send message. Meta suggested correct name and then participant confirmed. Then participant said “Oh it found it”. Then Meta mistakenly interpreted moderator’s name as “oh it found it”. Participant prompted Meta three times to correct name, then was able to send message."
1039,2025-12-18 09:28:59.051,549,"Participant notes that when a message arrives and Meta reads the message, it turns the sound from the YouTube video down but doesn’t completely turn it off."
1039,2025-12-18 09:37:20.152,1050,"Participant had to re-dictate message because when she would take a pause Meta would assume she was done with the message and prompt her to send it."
1039,2025-12-18 09:38:24.466,1114,"Participant noted that YouTube video closed out on its own while she was answering message even though it was not finished."
1039,2025-12-18 09:39:10.404,1160,"Participant notes it also closed the screen, which she doesn’t recall doing manually."
1039,2025-12-18 09:40:02.853,1213,"Participant states Meta informed her that there was a long message from Steve but didn’t read the message out loud."
1039,2025-12-18 09:40:57.086,1267,"Participant notes that now when she gets a message the YouTube pauses."
1039,2025-12-18 09:43:01.482,1391,"Participant notes the experience is a lot more engaged with glasses, meaning that if she was with a person in the real world and got a message she’d be notified and then would have to take the glasses off or say “hey Meta stop” whereas with AirPods she could just take one out of her ear and it would cause the input to stop."
1039,2025-12-18 09:44:35.164,1485,"When participant received the most recent message from moderator, phone paused the video. As she was sending the message on WhatsApp, the display on the screen again turned off."
1039,2025-12-18 09:44:54.156,1504,"Participant feels that these glasses are more comfortable, a bit smaller, and don’t slide down the bridge of her nose."
1039,2025-12-18 09:46:50.806,1621,"Participant again received a notification from Meta that indicated that Steve had sent a long message. She said “Hey Meta, read the message.” meta read a portion of the message but then said that was all it was able to read right now. Participant had to check WhatsApp on the phone to read the rest of the message before responding."
1039,2025-12-18 09:48:02.948,1693,"Participant thinks that when she receives a message it pauses the video, but when she’s sending a message it just turns the volume of the video down."
1039,2025-12-18 09:50:01.406,1811,"Participant notes that this time, Meta paused the video both when she received the message and when she sent the message out, which was different than before."
1039,2025-12-18 09:51:00.005,1870,"Participant has moved to the dark green chair."
1039,2025-12-18 10:04:45.877,2696,"Participant likes these glasses better than gen 3 glasses because they are more simple and the display is too much."
1039,2025-12-18 10:07:09.638,2840,"Participant would use Gen II glasses for daily use because they’re less bulky and don’t have the strain of the screen. Feels like she would prefer the Gen III glasses if they work in the dark because she could scroll in bed in a dark bedroom without disturbing her partner or putting her neck in an unhealthy position."
1039,2025-12-18 10:18:43.563,3534,"Participant feels like the experience of the scavenger hunt with Gen II glasses is very similar to experience with Gen III glasses. Gen II glasses experience is nice because it is simpler without the screen."
1039,2025-12-18 10:20:17.854,3628,"Participant has switched to the grey couch."
1039,2025-12-18 10:38:05.150,4695,"Participant moved to light green chair."
