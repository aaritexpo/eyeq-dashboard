1039,2025-12-17 12:56:37.103,114,"Participant starts session on the grey couch."
1039,2025-12-17 12:57:46.092,183,"Participant states “the live captions kinda suck”. States the captioning is “kind of delayed” and doesn’t get everything."
1039,2025-12-17 12:58:14.204,211,"Notes that the captions haven’t updated “in like six sentences”."
1039,2025-12-17 12:59:39.924,297,"Participant states the live captions will catch about three words from the sentence and then put a period after them as if it’s a whole sentence. Then every few sentences it does capture the whole thing."
1039,2025-12-17 13:01:32.451,410,"Participant states it froze for about a minute and when moderator asked “still frozen?” It captioned that. Afterwards, it continued to not capture full sentences."
1039,2025-12-17 13:03:15.203,512,"Participant states it hasn’t caught a caption in about two minutes. Participant used “back” finger gesture to exit captions and then re-open them. It then captioned successfully for about 15 seconds before it became slow again."
1039,2025-12-17 13:07:49.813,787,"Participant states there are gaps between when the captions accurately display a full sentence and in between those gaps, there are no captions or scattered words. Participant noted that when moderator began to ask a question, it seemed to do a better job displaying those words, but again began to lag shortly after."
1039,2025-12-17 13:12:49.761,1087,"Moderator took the phone back to start next video and asked how captioning was, participant stated it didn’t successfully caption much of the content. She again noted that when moderator began to talk it the glasses displayed more consistent captions."
1039,2025-12-17 13:13:35.731,1133,"As moderator pulled up next video, participant also noted that device attempted to caption sound coming from next stage."
1039,2025-12-17 13:20:25.184,1542,"Participant states captions are a little bit better with second video. The device will caption a few full sentences at a time as opposed to mostly scattered words in the prior video."
1039,2025-12-17 13:26:24.364,1901,"Participant states that captions are kind of unusable. States that they seem to need more thinking time. Estimates that they pick up about one sentence per minute, which is not useful if watching a video with continuous speaking."
1039,2025-12-17 13:26:37.661,1915,"Participant has moved to the dark green chair."
1039,2025-12-17 13:30:27.749,2145,"Participant asked Meta a question and device responded without issue. However, on second question participant had to prompt meta four times because each time it appeared frozen and didn’t reply."
1039,2025-12-17 13:33:41.799,2339,"Participant asked Meta to provide a description for a book. Meta read the subtitle and provided a description on the display, but participant was unable to scroll at first. Participant then opened book and asked for more information with success."
1039,2025-12-17 13:42:05.803,2843,"Participant switched to light green chair."
1039,2025-12-17 13:51:23.612,3401,"Participant faces dark green chair for the majority of video call."
1039,2025-12-17 13:56:53.473,3731,"Participant moved to grey couch."
1039,2025-12-17 14:00:18.877,3936,"Participant states during the video call she could see the moderator very well. Looked towards wall behind green chair because it was the best background."
1039,2025-12-17 14:01:10.919,3988,"Participant notes that glasses slide down her face when she looks down to complete Lego task."
1039,2025-12-17 14:01:27.167,4004,"She holds the glasses up with her left hand while completing Lego task."
1039,2025-12-17 14:06:28.894,4306,"Participant states it is slightly easier to see the display while inside, but not by much."
1039,2025-12-17 14:19:11.834,5069,"Participant again notes that glasses slide down her nose when she is looking down towards legos."
1039,2025-12-17 14:41:52.976,6430,"Participant notes glasses are at 15%."
1039,2025-12-17 14:54:01.053,7158,"Participant notes it feels like she’s been looking at her phone for a bit, mainly when straining to look at photo on display."
