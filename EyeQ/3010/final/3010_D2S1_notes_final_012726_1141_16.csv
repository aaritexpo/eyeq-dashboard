3010,2026-01-27 09:39:07.045,107,"Driving in a Hyundai Elantra with a black interior."
3010,2026-01-27 09:42:53.352,334,"Weather conditions are sunny."
3010,2026-01-27 09:52:44.635,925,"Participant states reels are easy to see."
3010,2026-01-27 09:53:24.639,965,"Participant is aware of a slight motion sickness. States it’s not terrible right now, he is just aware of it."
3010,2026-01-27 09:59:33.792,1334,"Participant likes using the glasses outside, but would prefer to not be in a moving car. He still wishes he could increase the brightness more, but recognizes that he felt that way inside too."
3010,2026-01-27 10:01:22.142,1442,"States it’s hard to see with a remixed background behind the image. He is positioning the glasses so it’s focused on asphalt or a car so the background isn’t as mixed. He notes this is mostly unconscious, he’s not purposefully positioning the exact location of the screen, but it is something he notices."
3010,2026-01-27 10:09:41.430,1942,"Participant states words on the screen are easy to read. Things can look a little bit pixelated but participant states it doesn’t detract from the experience."
3010,2026-01-27 10:14:51.025,2251,"Participant states if something’s gonna make him nauseous it will be using the phone."
3010,2026-01-27 10:19:33.043,2533,"Participant states there’s a decent amount of network issues, finds Instagram reels are loading very slowly. This is on the glasses and on the phone."
3010,2026-01-27 10:31:17.661,3238,"Participant is unsure when it’s ok for him to continue talking to Meta without saying “hey Meta” because sometimes Meta picks up that he is still talking but other times it doesn’t respond to him unless he says “hey Meta” again. He thought that “when the blue circle increases” in Meta AI it means Meta is listening for his response, but it doesn’t always respond to him after he speaks to it."
3010,2026-01-27 10:32:24.329,3305,"Participant likes the responsiveness of the Maps app. He notes the map rotates when he turns his head."
3010,2026-01-27 10:34:59.599,3460,"Participant likes that when he puts the display to sleep, he still gets a little notification in the Maps app to turn at the appropriate time. He states a little box appeared on the bottom right telling him to turn right in 500 feet even though the rest of the display was off. It then disappeared after a few seconds."
3010,2026-01-27 10:41:50.995,3871,"Mid session lux measurements:
Hood: 83880, 83960, 83120.
Dashboard: 81500, 81230, 31190.
Passenger seat: 36030, 38850, 38580.
Passenger window: 30090, 30840, 31530."
3010,2026-01-27 10:45:24.478,4085,"Participant reports motion sickness is low right now, similar to how he felt at the beginning of the session. He states it was worst when he was scrolling on the phone before maps. He felt the best, meaning least motion sickness, during the Maps section."
3010,2026-01-27 11:10:23.785,5584,"Participant wishes there was an easier way to change volume so that he didn’t have to go back to the main screen with the volume menu."
3010,2026-01-27 11:15:11.817,5872,"Participant feels like he has to use his right eye more than his left eye. Feels like his right eye is focused on the display while his left eye is “kind of just there”. Participant then covered right lens with hand and states he didn’t realize that the display was only on the right eye. States that it now makes sense why he felt like his right eye was doing more work."
