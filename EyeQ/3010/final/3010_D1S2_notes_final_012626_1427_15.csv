3010,2026-01-26 12:28:37.998,195,"Had to switch neural band prior to start of session, as another participant needed a size 2 due to larger wrist size.

3010,2026-01-26 13:31:07.667,3944,"Participant doesn’t like that Meta adds his filler words when he is dictating a message in WhatsApp. Explains that ”it makes me very aware of them”."
