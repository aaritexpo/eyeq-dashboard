Participant ID,Timestamp,Global Time (seconds),Note
3010,2026-01-28 12:24:49.398,215,"Participant notes that he couldn’t find the contact he was looking for on WhatsApp on the glasses display. However, he could find the contact on the phone WhatsApp. Text threads were in a different order on the glasses vs phone, which he notes was odd."
3010,2026-01-28 12:33:59.641,765,"Participant has eye strain pretty consistently at a low level while the glasses are on."
3010,2026-01-28 12:44:24.203,1390,"In regular life, participant prefers voice messages to dictation messages. Notes that dictation software made an error in his last message, which is why he prefers audio messages. He hates typing messages."
3010,2026-01-28 12:49:23.069,1689,"Participant notes WhatsApp thread shows the participant’s response above the moderator’s question (out of order)."
3010,2026-01-28 12:53:50.413,1956,"Participant feels like the device does a good job of picking up basic neural gestures, but not more advanced things like zooming. Also notes there’s a delay between him performing the finger gestures and the device’s response, which was useful when he was first learning but not as useful now that he feels proficient with hand gestures."
3010,2026-01-28 12:57:27.526,2173,"Participant feels like Meta’s answers to his questions today are significantly better than they were the last time he asked similar questions in a prior section."
3010,2026-01-28 13:22:23.726,3669,"Participant feels like audio quality of video call was good and it felt like a regular FaceTime. Feels like it’s odd that the video he sends is what he’s looking at."
3010,2026-01-28 13:31:14.855,4200,"Participant went to the bathroom with glasses on around minute 63, returned around minute 69."
3010,2026-01-28 13:47:42.465,5188,"Participant notes the Lego task is challenging indoors and outdoors. It is hard to see which exact block it wants and harder to see the exact placement especially when building the base. He has to squint to see which row the Legos are supposed to be on."
3010,2026-01-28 13:48:26.464,5232,"Participant also notes the colors in the WhatsApp images are still off compared to the colors of the actual blocks."
3010,2026-01-28 13:49:15.980,5282,"Participant does not appear to be closing either eye to see images."
3010,2026-01-28 13:53:11.364,5517,"Participant does close left eye periodically."
3010,2026-01-28 13:53:32.955,5539,"Participant notes that he definitely closed them less in this session compared to yesterday. He closes eye to see detail. Felt like he had left eye closed for a significant portion of time yesterday."
3010,2026-01-28 13:53:50.177,5556,"Participant notes that screen times out after a short while, which is annoying."
3010,2026-01-28 13:59:01.771,5867,"Participant feels like sometimes Meta AI “tries to be too smart for its own good”. For example, earlier in the session when he asked Meta what the top 10 books were that people have read, he states Meta gave an overly specific example of the top 10 Goodreads books from this month. He explains that he feels like Meta is trying to assume what the person wants instead of responding literally to the question that was asked."
3010,2026-01-28 14:16:48.366,6934,"Participant notes it takes a bit for images to not be blurry after receiving them."
