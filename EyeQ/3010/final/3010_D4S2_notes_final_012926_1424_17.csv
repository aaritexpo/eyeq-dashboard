3010,2026-01-29 12:28:18.186,387,"Participant does not like the fact that he has no way to tell when he’s started a video. Also, doesn’t like that you have to say “Hey Meta” in order to stop a video after it has started. He also doesn’t like that Meta never speaks during the video taking process. There is no feedback from the device until after the video has stopped."
3010,2026-01-29 12:34:02.258,731,"Participant sent a video to moderator. He notes that instead of sending the video he already took, the device took a new video and sent it to moderator. He thinks he changed the language of his verbal command slightly, which caused it to take a new video."
3010,2026-01-29 12:35:00.959,790,"Small differences in his commands cause the device to send the most recently taken photo or video or take a new photo or video to send."
3010,2026-01-29 12:35:57.517,846,"Participant states the device does not understand when he says “yes” a significant portion of the time. It also doesn’t respond when he says something other than yes, like “I sure am”."
3010,2026-01-29 12:42:29.320,1238,"Participant tends to lay across couch rather than sitting up straight."
3010,2026-01-29 12:47:08.509,1517,"Participant dislikes that he has to say “hey Meta” for “literally every command”."
3010,2026-01-29 12:48:12.823,1582,"Participant states it hasn’t picked up his “yes” three times in a row. Participant feels negatively about this."
3010,2026-01-29 13:05:39.913,2629,"Participant notes this version definitely has a more accurate response than the newer glasses."
3010,2026-01-29 13:17:27.725,3336,"Participant states version two of the glasses has more of a personality.  Also states the voice changes inflection. For example, it sounded excited to answer the last question the participant asked. States he doesn’t know why they switched to version 3."
3010,2026-01-29 13:25:58.274,3847,"Participant is unable to play Spotify using voice commands. States when he tells Meta to play Spotify, it indicates that it will start to play but then does not start the song. Participant started Spotify using the iPhone instead."
3010,2026-01-29 13:28:19.984,3989,"Participant notes that when he receives a short message, Spotify is paused but automatically restarts after sending the message. But when the message is longer, Spotify does not automatically restart."
3010,2026-01-29 13:29:40.569,4069,"Eye strain and general discomfort are better with these glasses than with the other pair. Participant would describe it as noticeable but very mild. Thinks the optometry exams may contribute to the eye strain and discomfort."
3010,2026-01-29 13:46:54.785,5104,"Participant explains that Meta skipped notifications for the last two messages and didn’t read the most recent message when he asked it to."
3010,2026-01-29 14:17:39.852,6949,"Participant feels like generation 2 glasses are useless for navigation."
3010,2026-01-29 14:17:57.248,6966,"Participant prefers newer glasses for taking pictures to see the field of view."
3010,2026-01-29 14:18:27.532,6996,"Gen 2 glasses are lighter and more form fitting which he likes. They do feel sharper and dig into his skin a little bit."
3010,2026-01-29 14:20:54.523,7143,"If given the choice, participant would prefer to use a phone rather than using the glasses at all. Feels like the only good use case for the glasses are pictures and video given the current state of the device. If some of the small issues were resolved the glasses might feel more useful."
