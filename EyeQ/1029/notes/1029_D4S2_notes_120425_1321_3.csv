When she is sitting in the dark green chair or on grey couch, the lifts feel very strong. Feels like the light reflects off the glasses a little bit. Would not have noticed the eye strain if it was not for the glasses. Emphasizes that the eye strain is from the interaction of lights with glasses, not from the glasses themselves."
