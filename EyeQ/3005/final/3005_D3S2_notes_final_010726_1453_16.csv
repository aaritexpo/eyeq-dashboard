3005,2026-01-07 12:51:57.686,239,"Participant states the turtle in the image looks yellow while the turtle in real life looks orange."
3005,2026-01-07 12:54:47.065,408,"Participant is unsure how to send the picture in WhatsApp using finger gestures. Used verbal command instead."
3005,2026-01-07 13:09:51.029,1312,"Participant previously had the camera open to take pictures and send them on WhatsApp, so she saw the images before they were sent. This time, she told Meta to take the picture and send it from outside the camera app, so she did not ever see the image. She assumes the image was sent because Meta confirmed that it sent."

3005,2026-01-07 13:42:06.375,3248,"Participant feels like she’s not doing the finger gestures well, she wanted to scroll down but it went back instead."
3005,2026-01-07 13:47:57.114,3599,"Participant feels like if she tries to squeeze her fingers together more than tap them together then the neural band picks up the correct gesture."
3005,2026-01-07 13:49:51.120,3713,"Participant loosens and readjusts neural band."
3005,2026-01-07 13:51:03.473,3785,"Participant bends her left arm and looks down at it to see display against a dark background. Her jacket is black, which provides a black background."
