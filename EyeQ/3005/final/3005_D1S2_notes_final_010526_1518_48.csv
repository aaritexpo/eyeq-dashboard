3005,2026-01-05 13:27:07.667,686,"Participant states that it feels like there is glare everywhere, which makes it hard to see. Navigates to settings to adjust brightness."

Wishes there were some type of focusing test in the device so she could change the image in a way that makes it clearer for her to see."

3005,2026-01-05 13:46:24.894,1844,"Participant states eye keeps going to the right to make the double vision go away but it doesn’t really go away."

3005,2026-01-05 13:49:30.050,2029,"Participant prompted Meta three times to tell her a fun fact about dolphins. She states the first three times meta displayed words but didn’t speak. After fourth prompt, Meta did speak and displayed words and images. However, the image did not load."
3005,2026-01-05 13:50:39.847,2098,"Participant asked another question and notes that Meta displayed a response with a picture that was not visible. Additionally, the voice went in and out as if Meta was glitching."
3005,2026-01-05 13:54:43.280,2342,"Participant states the display didn’t match what was said, and was a different format than the other displays because it had three panels instead of one.

3005,2026-01-05 13:59:40.337,2639,"Meta abruptly stopped talking in the middle of an answer. Participant notes she flipped her page and wonders if the device interpreted the hand movement as a gesture, prompting it to stop talking."
3005,2026-01-05 14:00:30.255,2689,"Participant asked the same question twice and got different output from the device. Notes the second output showed multiple display panels that weren’t directly related to the question."
3005,2026-01-05 14:02:32.294,2811,"Participant feels like she’s not doing the finger gestures right sometimes, which causes her to not be able to access the information she wants after asking Meta a question and reading the display output."
3005,2026-01-05 14:06:28.050,3047,"Participant attempted to click one of Meta’s answers to expand on it, but states it showed a green dot at the top of the display and a spinning wheel at the bottom. Participant used the “back” finger gesture to exit from that prompt."

3005,2026-01-05 14:28:59.509,4398,"Participant did not receive a notification for message received from moderator. Noticed that band says it is not connected in iPhone settings.

3005,2026-01-05 14:34:13.174,4712,"Participant can see two received messages from moderator but isn’t able to send a message due to the spinning wheel and a ringtone. The ringtone plays for a few seconds and then returns her to the main screen of the display."

3005,2026-01-05 14:54:00.179,5899,"Participant navigated to Maps, clicked dictation search, searched directions to Costco, and states that search gave her walking directions."
3005,2026-01-05 14:55:02.644,5961,"Participant states device continues to return to the Home Screen while she tries to explore maps."
3005,2026-01-05 14:56:52.220,6071,"Participant states either using the pillow as a background or tilting her head to the right helps by “making the double vision better”."
3005,2026-01-05 15:00:01.038,6260,"Participant states it’s not necessarily a double vision but she wants to look to the right as if she’s trying to look past something. If she closes her left eye it’s perfectly clear. Not so much double vision as much as her vision is saying “this is not clear, look to the right”. When she is on the screen with all the apps she has a feeling that her eyes want to look to the right to get a better, clearer image. States maybe the problem is the location of the display. She would expect the display to be more centered."
3005,2026-01-05 15:02:14.294,6393,"Battery is on 5%."

3005,2026-01-05 15:15:33.728,7192,"Participant expects device to work similar to other devices and i is not working with the commands she wants it to do. Her eyes are constantly adjusting to see the floating image clearly. She is attending to that too much and it takes up brain space and “probably adds frustration level”. However, it is not causing any physical strain."
