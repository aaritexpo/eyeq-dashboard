3005,2026-01-07 09:11:08.040,198,"Participant notes that naturally her eyes are drawn to outside scenery, so she is looking at her surroundings in addition to the glasses display, whereas yesterday she felt like she was only looking at the glasses display because she was in the room."
3005,2026-01-07 09:12:13.551,264,"Weather conditions are cloudy."
3005,2026-01-07 09:19:11.204,681,"Participant states that device would be nice to have on a road trip and it’s nice to look at the device while doing something else (being driven around) rather than just sitting in a room."
3005,2026-01-07 09:55:22.522,2853,"Participant states it’s easier to see the display right now, feels like it looks bigger than usual and likes that she can use the black dashboard of the car as a background."
3005,2026-01-07 10:05:38.797,3469,"Pulled over to take lux measurements.

3005,2026-01-07 10:10:49.745,3780,"Participant again notes how much easier it is to look at the display when she can look at the black dashboard of the car as a background. Explains that she can’t enjoy the features as much when she is using the glasses in the room because she has to find specific ways to look at the display given all the objects and different backgrounds in the room."
3005,2026-01-07 10:49:17.627,6088,"Participant took glasses off for about five seconds. Put them back on immediately at the direction of the moderator. Notes she is used to wearing readers, which she takes off and puts back on frequently."
3005,2026-01-07 10:50:56.157,6186,"Participant states she now gets why the display is only on one side. Explains that if she were in an environment like a car where things are happening she wouldn’t want the display to be right in front of her face. Explains that this is different from the indoor environment she is used to from the past few days."
3005,2026-01-07 10:58:35.673,6646,"Participant notes that she checked the “glasses” box when she meant to check the “phone” box on the last survey."
