1092,2026-01-20 12:37:41.806,1416,"Participant likes scrolling reels on the glasses aside from the fact that it is hard to scroll. States it takes him five times each time he initiates a scrolling movement, but other movements are fine. For example, it was easy for him to adjust the volume."
1092,2026-01-20 12:39:50.604,1545,"Participant states the audio seems louder when it comes from the phone to the glasses (watching reels on the phone) vs when it comes from the glasses (watching reels on the glasses) even when the volume is at the same level on the glasses and on the phone."
1092,2026-01-20 12:46:11.004,1926,"While on the grey couch and watching reels on the glasses for the first 20 minutes, participant looked straight ahead at the black TV screen. Now that he is watching reels on the phone from the light green chair, he holds the phone in his left hand, rests it on his left thigh, and looks downward at the phone screen."
1092,2026-01-20 12:55:41.492,2496,"Participant prefers to watch videos on the phone vs the glasses because it feels like his “off eye is struggling”. The eye that is not directly focused on the display “doesn’t know what to do” because it can’t see the display directly."
1092,2026-01-20 12:57:45.966,2621,"Participant states he still has trouble scrolling when watching videos on the glasses display. After watching participant scroll, suggested that participant try to keep index finger still and only use thumb movement to scroll. After trying this, participant notes improved ability to scroll."
1092,2026-01-20 12:58:30.674,2665,"Participant also tightened neural band and noted this helped him scroll with more ease."
1092,2026-01-20 13:02:07.742,2882,"Participant states it’s almost as if the left eye causes a glare. If he closes left eye, things are much clearer. This is exacerbated by anything being in the background."
1092,2026-01-20 13:03:23.265,2958,"Participant tries to mitigate the glare by looking at a solid background. From the dark grey chair, he looks at the off white curtain."
1092,2026-01-20 13:35:57.289,4912,"Participant moved to light green chair and is watching reels on the glasses display display while looking downward."
1092,2026-01-20 13:39:37.548,5132,"Participant wonders if they could design something that could block out the eye that is not being used when users are doing something like watching reels. However, he states that he only closes his left eye once in a while."
1092,2026-01-20 14:01:36.863,6452,"Participant left to go to bathroom at 100 minutes. Returned now. Kept glasses on."
1092,2026-01-20 14:06:25.134,6740,"Participant states he gets dry eye a few minutes into each reels session on the glasses and it resolves when he begins to watch videos on the phone again."
1092,2026-01-20 14:07:57.639,6832,"Participant notes discomfort on the “brim of his nose” and the sides of his head from the glasses. Also notes that he’s not sure why, since he didn’t have any discomfort yesterday."
