1092,2026-01-19 12:52:31.396,533,"Participant states he took a video and it automatically sent to moderator."
1092,2026-01-19 12:56:36.104,778,"Participant states the reason why it sent the video automatically is because he took the video while in the message thread."
1092,2026-01-19 12:59:13.132,935,"Participant states finger gestures are the hardest part. Moderator suggests moving thumb along top of index finger instead of swiping up into the air. After making this change, participant feels that device response is improved."
1092,2026-01-19 13:03:52.946,1214,"Participant states it’s harder to take images using finger gestures than it is using verbal commands."
1092,2026-01-19 13:05:18.467,1300,"Participant states that pictures and videos are very clear."
1092,2026-01-19 13:09:55.565,1577,"Participant went to camera roll and attempted to use the select button to play the video on the screen. However, when he pressed the play button on the video, glasses began to play music from Spotify. Participant told Meta to close Spotify."
1092,2026-01-19 13:13:14.010,1775,"Participant tried again to play the video in the camera roll, using both finger gestures and verbal commands, without success."
1092,2026-01-19 13:16:25.265,1967,"Participant states taps work but scrolling is not easy to do. Moderator recommended keeping index finger still while using thumb to scroll."
1092,2026-01-19 13:16:56.520,1998,"Participant notes that in real life he typically uses his phone with his left hand instead of his right hand."
1092,2026-01-19 13:20:36.974,2218,"Participant asked a question about sports and notes that Meta put the wrong team logo with each team in the display."
1092,2026-01-19 13:21:35.864,2277,"Participant asked Meta who will win tonight’s game, first Meta said that one team had a 79% chance of winning, but second time it said the other team had a 73% chance of winning."
1092,2026-01-19 13:23:28.857,2390,"Participant states when he asks Meta a question, it answers verbally. It showed a visual display at first, but then display was replaced by a spinning circle."
1092,2026-01-19 13:24:59.695,2481,"Participant states display is now back with Meta AI responses."
1092,2026-01-19 13:42:18.888,3520,"Participant wonders if there’s a way to make Meta stop searching for new things after delivering an answer. For example, he asked Meta about air fryer dinner ideas and he wanted Meta to keep explaining but didn’t want it to keep searching for new dinner ideas at the same time."
1092,2026-01-19 13:46:01.231,3743,"Every time participant opens Spotify it starts playing a completely different song."
1092,2026-01-19 13:48:06.932,3868,"Participant states he can only see the song that’s playing and forward, back and pause buttons. He can’t choose what he wants to play."
1092,2026-01-19 13:51:07.073,4049,"Participant used verbal command to play a specific song on Spotify since he could not do much with finger gestures."
1092,2026-01-19 13:54:51.362,4273,"Participant states he can see that you can do a lot with this device but doesn’t know that he would use it. He states it might be good for people crossing the street so they don’t have to stare at their phone."
1092,2026-01-19 13:56:27.948,4369,"Participant states it’s getting more comfortable to look at the screen. He’s sure there are settings that could make it so that the display doesn’t disappear so quickly."
1092,2026-01-19 14:02:31.439,4733,"Participant realized he didn’t fully send the message. He doesn’t see it in the WhatsApp thread. He is sending the message again. Notes that Meta is sensitive because it picked up the person in the next room over saying “hey Meta”."
1092,2026-01-19 14:07:52.840,5054,"Participant wishes there was a way for him to type words with his fingers so that autocorrect doesn’t mess up the words he is saying. Participant gave a list of town names in his last text and reports that Meta misspelled all of them."
1092,2026-01-19 14:16:10.245,5552,"Participant rolls eyes backwards about once every ten minutes, often briefly closes left eye afterwards."
1092,2026-01-19 14:17:52.480,5654,"Participant asked where the nearest gas station is. It showed him a location but didn’t say anything. A few seconds later, participant says Meta said “this feature is in Beta”."
1092,2026-01-19 14:20:03.060,5785,"Participant states when both eyes are open and he’s looking at the display, there’s a bit of a glare or blur. It’s not much of a blur but it’s enough. It’s much better when he closes left eye. However, he doesn’t keep left eye closed for extended periods of time and only does it once or twice for every ten minute period."
1092,2026-01-19 14:21:20.186,5862,"Participant states glasses are picking up everything that the person in the next room is saying. Participant states if he was walking down the street in NYC, he’s sure this would be a problem."
1092,2026-01-19 14:22:35.671,5937,"Participant states battery is at 15%."
1092,2026-01-19 14:25:01.944,6083,"Participant has asked about the nearest QuikTrip multiple times. Every time he asks, it gives him nearest 7/11s. Participant started walking directions. He was informed by Meta that feature is still in Beta."
1092,2026-01-19 14:28:12.748,6274,"Participant states all directions are waking which is kind of useless."
1092,2026-01-19 14:37:34.704,6836,"Participant switched out glasses 11 for glasses 12."
