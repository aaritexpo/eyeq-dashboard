1092,2026-01-21 09:01:38.019,491,"Participant asked Meta to take an image and notes that Meta showed a picture of kiwis. Meta somehow navigated to history and live AI. Participant was able to navigate back to camera."
1092,2026-01-21 09:03:49.562,622,"When participant asked meta to zoom in to photo, it brought up a different photo."
1092,2026-01-21 09:07:06.353,819,"Participant asked Meta to send picture on his display to moderator, but Meta instead took a new image and sent it to moderator."
1092,2026-01-21 09:08:48.237,921,"Participant notes when he tells it to send the picture, that causes a problem."
1092,2026-01-21 09:11:10.381,1063,"Participant states there is more blur while outside. When outside in a sunnier area or looking at something brighter, he notes it is similar to when you turn the brightness up too high on a TV. He notes this refers to the glasses in general, not only when using the camera app."
1092,2026-01-21 09:15:14.880,1308,"Weather conditions were cloudy at beginning of session, but Sun is coming out at this time."
1092,2026-01-21 09:29:03.199,2136,"When participant zooms, as soon as he unpinches his finger the zoom goes away. He can still take a picture zoomed in, but notes that he has to do it quickly."
1092,2026-01-21 09:50:16.171,3409,"Participant doesn’t notice any differences between finger gestures when outside even though his hands feel cold. Feels like finger gestures are better today and wonders if it’s due to hand and arm position."
1092,2026-01-21 09:51:16.702,3470,"Participant feels like he has to speak louder when outside because Meta probably picks up outside noise."
1092,2026-01-21 09:52:33.441,3546,"Participant feels like display is pretty clear when standing in direct sunlight. Photos also look clear."
1092,2026-01-21 09:54:15.692,3649,"Participant no longer notices blur while standing in direct sunlight."
1092,2026-01-21 09:59:34.698,3968,"Participant notes now that he’s in the shade, the colors in the picture are too light and don’t pop out."
1092,2026-01-21 10:11:54.648,4708,"Participant is squinting with left eye as he tries to view images for Lego task. Participant states it’s bright enough and he is able to zoom in on WhatsApp images, but it is hard to tell what side of the Lego the curve is on (referring to curved Lego pieces)."
1092,2026-01-21 10:20:33.673,5227,"Participant states picture looks very red but the corresponding Lego color is orange."
1092,2026-01-21 10:26:23.234,5576,"Participant states he gets impatient because he selects a picture, then tries to go back, but sometimes the display turns off, then he tries to navigate back to where he was, but sometimes it doesn’t pick up his finger gestures quickly enough."
1092,2026-01-21 10:30:13.787,5807,"Participant wonders if there’s a way to prevent the display from turning off right before it’s going to turn off, but can’t think of any way to do this without disrupting the image he’s trying to keep on the screen."
1092,2026-01-21 10:49:25.311,6958,"Participant states in the images on the glasses display it can be hard to tell the difference between green and teal pieces. It’s easier to differentiate the light blue pieces."
