1092,2026-01-19 09:56:48.234,2463,"Participant states it’s harder to see the pathways in the hypertrail game now that he has moved from the grey couch to the grey chair. He is using the white curtain as a backdrop."

1092,2026-01-19 10:18:32.916,3768,"Participant states the call was clear and he could see the moderator well. He could see when the moderator’s eyes moved. States that the audio was good as well after he got it figured out."

1092,2026-01-19 10:34:02.148,4697,"Participant states Meta won’t give specifics about where the image he’s looking at is. Just states that there is a lake and a mountain."
