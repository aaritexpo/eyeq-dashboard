Participant ID,Timestamp,Global Time (seconds),Note
1005,2025-11-04 13:25:15.373,217,"Instagram is taking a few minutes to load. Showing four blocks and he can’t access the fifth."
1005,2025-11-04 13:29:28.760,470,"Participant notes has to tilt his head back in a way that is uncomfortable to see the screen"
1005,2025-11-04 13:35:20.132,822,"Troubleshooting MR Reels. Participant began to watch vibes first."
1005,2025-11-04 13:38:10.161,992,"Device goes straight from on to off, as opposed to iPhone where the screen dims for a few seconds and gives you a chance to touch the display and make sure the screen doesn’t turn off."
1005,2025-11-04 13:40:40.696,1142,"Participant watching vibes for two 15 minute blocks in a row, still troubleshooting MR Reels."
1005,2025-11-04 13:56:47.036,2109,"When he opened what’s app to try to watch MR Reels, the videos are there but he cannot watch them because there is a spinning wheel of death."
1005,2025-11-04 14:03:05.354,2487,"Participant will continue to watch vibes on phone display."
1005,2025-11-04 14:17:21.714,3343,"When message opens in what’s app, it opens at the bottom of the message screen. This means participant has to scroll all the way to the top to see the beginning of the message, instead of the app automatically opening at the top of the message thread."
1005,2025-11-04 14:17:49.555,3371,"Feels comfortable for eyes to watch video, but would prefer more contrast and brightness."
1005,2025-11-04 14:22:03.310,3625,"Left eye slightly irritated. Would probably go away if he used eye drops."
1005,2025-11-04 14:26:58.128,3920,"Was using blue jeans pants leg as background, but looked up a little and it caught the edge of the table, so looked up towards black screen of TV as an ideal background."
1005,2025-11-04 14:29:19.850,4061,"Depending on what he is looking at on the screen, the level of opacity differs. For example, videos should be more opaque and captions or maps could be more transparent."
1005,2025-11-04 14:38:46.096,4628,"Using hand as controller feels just slightly different than playing video games with a controller."
1005,2025-11-04 14:53:10.937,5492,"Participant was talking to moderator about how he doesn’t have eye strain or nausea and meta thought participant was talking to it, so gave advice on eye strain or nausea and terminated MR Reels. Participant told meta he was having an outside conversation and began watching reels again."
1005,2025-11-04 15:01:56.007,6018,"Would prefer longer videos."
1005,2025-11-04 15:15:56.466,6858,"Feels that quality is good. Feels comfortable. Device moves with your head as opposed to a TV where the TV continues to be straight even if you lean over. So he wouldn’t necessarily want to lean head onto something while using these glasses like he would if he was watching TV."
1005,2025-11-04 15:19:38.795,7080,"It was more enjoyable to watch on the phone because the colors are better and there is no issue with contrast and transparency."
