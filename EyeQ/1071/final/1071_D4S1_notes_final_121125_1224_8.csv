1071,2025-12-11 10:37:07.198,878,"Glasses won’t send media, despite having good connection on app, and Wi-Fi, what’s app is connected. Just keeps saying “sending failed”"
1071,2025-12-11 10:43:24.199,1255,"When Pt tries to send videos over what’s app, it clogs up the queue and won’t allow anything to be sent, which is why we got a sending failed message earlier"
1071,2025-12-11 11:38:15.681,4546,"PT mentioned that it’s inconvenient that although the messages get read out loud, it doesn’t give them the option to reply. They have to say “hey meta reply”. PT compared it to their AirPods and how those prompt you to reply when a message comes through"
1071,2025-12-11 11:47:47.788,5118,"PT mentioned they would like more discretion when video recording. Mentioned that at their work site, it would be nice to record patio layouts. But having to explain to the customer why they’re recording is a hassle"
1071,2025-12-11 11:55:09.514,5560,"PT mentioned that meta said “new long message on what’s app” instead of reading it out loud. Had to ask meta to read it"
1071,2025-12-11 12:08:40.232,6371,"Moderator liked a message in the chat, and it pinged the glasses but didn’t tell PT what action was done. A message saying “- liked a message” would be great"
1071,2025-12-11 12:15:17.022,6767,"PT complained that meta doesn’t let them finish talking before giving a response"
