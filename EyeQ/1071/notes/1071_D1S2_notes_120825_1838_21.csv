1071,2025-12-08 17:10:26.902,638,"For the capture and share task, the video recording froze at a point when the user tried to move their head around. Also meta kept sending a previously recorded video instead of an updated one."
1071,2025-12-08 17:16:05.768,977,"Meta sent photos and videos that were initially taken but at a point it just stopped sending the media files. Some of the files would show up in the meta app but were not sent through WhatsApp."
1071,2025-12-08 17:17:06.325,1037,"It appears that the files are not shared until they uploaded in the meta app."
1071,2025-12-08 17:24:37.195,1488,"Capturing media through the glasses with the band worked fine. However, the files were not being shared on WhatsApp maybe because of the internet. Files were visible through the meta app , waiting to be imported into the gallery."
1071,2025-12-08 17:27:24.023,1655,"The glasses froze again while the video was being recorded."
1071,2025-12-08 17:27:41.300,1672,"Band disconnected at a point on its own."
1071,2025-12-08 17:28:04.097,1695,"The video being recorded was also lagging ."
1071,2025-12-08 17:31:13.272,1884,"The battery of these glasses pair seems to run down very quickly . Only 30 min into the session and they were down to about 60%."
1071,2025-12-08 17:37:39.080,2270,"Pop up was blank / blue square intermittently as though it didn’t fully load the response. This was for the meta scavenger hunt ."
1071,2025-12-08 17:43:11.140,2602,"The user kept adjust the glasses - as in sliding them up against the eye."
1071,2025-12-08 17:46:43.796,2815,"The band ending in 005X would occasionally disconnect via Bluetooth and would have to be reconnected although it didn’t have a low battery."
1071,2025-12-08 17:53:55.996,3247,"During meta scavenger hunt , meta would start responding and stop at a point."
1071,2025-12-08 18:12:42.020,4373,"Some of the messages from WhatsApp did not com through . This happens when two messages are sent at the same time - they only get the most recent message . Also the user noticed that when the screen times out , meta announces the message but doesn’t show it on the screen."
1071,2025-12-08 18:14:19.797,4471,"The user mentioned that they didn’t like that meta doesn’t give them the option to respond to messages. They also didn’t like that it didn’t have a way of recognizing that the messages were read as they would still appear as notifications on the screen."
1071,2025-12-08 18:15:42.152,4553,"When multiple messages are sent it would sometimes read both /all and sometimes it would only read the most recent message."
1071,2025-12-08 18:20:37.419,4848,"The user mentioned they liked that they could multitask , see and hear the messages being read out."
1071,2025-12-08 18:22:02.838,4934,"Battery at 15%"
1071,2025-12-08 18:24:00.954,5052,"The glasses didn’t respond very well to the hand gestures when the battery was low."
1071,2025-12-08 18:32:14.261,5545,"Switching to glasses #15 ending in M0001. Battery of the previous pair of glasses run out (#1). We have 2 more tasks - maps and scavenger hunt each for 15 min."
1071,2025-12-08 18:36:30.410,5801,"Switched to glasses pair #15 - ending in 0001"
