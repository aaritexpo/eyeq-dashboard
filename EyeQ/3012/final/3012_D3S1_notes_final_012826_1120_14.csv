3012,2026-01-28 09:18:40.490,79,"Participant notices a white streak through right lens and discovers it is the overhead light causing this effect"
3012,2026-01-28 09:20:20.995,179,"Participant notices the streak is very position-dependent and when looking down toward brown coffee table (being used as solid, optimal background), the streak disappears"
3012,2026-01-28 09:26:41.957,560,"When asking participant about the responsiveness of the neural band to their hand gestures, participant expressed content but did say they feel like their ability to move dominant hand is impaired/prohibited due to neural band"
3012,2026-01-28 09:28:34.314,673,"Participant says they feel like they must keep dominant hand in a stiff position because they’re concerned about the neural band accidentally registering unintended movements"
3012,2026-01-28 09:29:27.916,726,"Participant wonders if it might be a better idea to have neural band on non-dominant hand in case they wanted to perform an action like scratch their head or write on paper while using the MR glasses"
3012,2026-01-28 09:31:33.215,852,"Participant makes it clear that they don’t prevent moving their hand/arm because they’re afraid they’ll lose the “sweet spot” and says they have gotten use to hand gesture movements and are generally content with the responsiveness"
3012,2026-01-28 09:41:31.957,1450,"Glasses disconnected audio and would no reconnect despite glasses being activated and connected in the app"
3012,2026-01-28 09:42:38.871,1517,"I attempted to close and open Meta app again which did not work. Bluetooth was connected in phone settings"
3012,2026-01-28 09:53:43.003,2181,"Participant notices that on Day 1, their left eye was attempting to focus on a display that wasn’t technically there since the display is positioned in the right lens. Now on Day 3, participant is noticing that their left eye has stopped trying to focus on a display that isn’t there and compares this experience to a blind spot similar to how the eyes ignore the nose that’s always there"
3012,2026-01-28 09:54:55.762,2254,"Participant wonders what effect this is having on their eyes especially as a person who has a dominant eye and less dominant eye (in terms of eyesight)"
3012,2026-01-28 09:56:14.437,2333,"Participant says they think their eyes have grown accustomed to the glasses as they feel less of an innate effort for their left eye to focus on non-display lens"
3012,2026-01-28 10:10:20.245,3179,"Display turned off while participant was watching Instagram reels but audio was still coming through. Neural band was connected but was not allowing participant to activate screen so we trouble shooter by turning glasses off and turning them back on which worked after a few seconds of reconnecting"
3012,2026-01-28 10:13:18.503,3357,"Participant’s head is slightly lowered so that gaze is focused on brown coffee table for optimal viewing experience"
3012,2026-01-28 10:51:00.744,5619,"Participant yawning and appears very tired"
