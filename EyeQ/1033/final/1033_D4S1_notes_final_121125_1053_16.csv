1033,2025-12-11 09:11:26.638,1258,"Glasses used for vast majority of session: 4V37W24H89010K and switched occurred within first 10 minutes"
1033,2025-12-11 09:15:57.848,1529,"I’m noticing participant’s inclination is to specify which object they want Meta to capture a picture of. For example, “Hey Meta, take a picture of this snow globe I’m holding in front of me”"
1033,2025-12-11 09:33:29.734,2581,"Participant amused / slightly annoyed by Meta’s inability to recognize they are having an external conversation"
1033,2025-12-11 09:35:19.074,2690,"Participant is often interrupted by Meta who is picking up on external conversations, asking participant to clarify or explain their question when they are not asking for Meta’s insight"
1033,2025-12-11 09:36:33.268,2764,"Participant does not get to finish their sentence or request before getting interrupted by Meta, which answers newer questions in context of previous information requests"
1033,2025-12-11 09:39:14.367,2925,"Participant notices delay in Meta’s information delivery and describes it as confusing and annoying given that it reverts back to previous requests when they’re trying to move on"

1033,2025-12-11 09:48:40.620,3492,"Participant expresses slight frustration with Meta as it often cuts them off and predicts the end of their question before participant can finish talking"
1033,2025-12-11 09:59:58.444,4169,"Hey Meta voice activation not responsive while listening to music. Participant notices dinging noises when asking Meta to send a message but sounds like they drop before messages are sent"
1033,2025-12-11 10:10:26.652,4798,"Participant seems to have learned to be more specific and patient when asking Meta questions or following up on specific commands. More clear language and slower execution"
1033,2025-12-11 10:13:21.046,4972,"Participant says their eyes feel strained and answered truthfully in survey, but clarifies with me that eyes are not strained specifically because they are wearing the current glasses. More so a culmination of time spent during broader study sessions"
1033,2025-12-11 10:16:25.969,5157,"Participant clarified that the combination of vision tests with optometrists and specific activities where they had to intensely analyze the contents in MR display could be large contributors as to why their eyes feel strained during this moment"

1033,2025-12-11 10:48:37.046,7088,"Participant expresses distaste toward Scavenger Hunt activity using Gen2 glasses because of aforementioned delays and cutting off sentences before getting the chance to finish. Participant says they didn’t notice this as pronounced in the MR glasses simply because they could see the screen and know exactly when Meta was done while these glasses offer no indication of when they have stopped listening to user or when they have finished dispelling information requested from participant."
1033,2025-12-11 10:49:59.491,7170,"Participant expresses desire to know exactly when Meta is listening, for Meta to recognize when they are having an external conversation, and to get Meta to stop talking when answering questions they are no longer interested in learning about"
