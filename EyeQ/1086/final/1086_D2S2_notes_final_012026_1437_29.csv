1086,2026-01-20 12:39:25.328,296,"Screen went completely black. “I see the outline where the video should be but no video or sound playing.”"
1086,2026-01-20 12:41:00.727,391,"User tried leaving instagram and going back but it made no difference. User turned off toggle switch for a few seconds and turned it back on. That fixed it."
1086,2026-01-20 12:45:37.855,669,"User looked up at the ceiling to rest the head. User was told to try to keep gaze within the room and avoid looking up at the ceiling lights."
1086,2026-01-20 12:49:58.992,930,"“I would prefer that the display screen doesnt turn when I turn my head because when my head is tilted while I rest it on my arm, the display is also tilted at an angle.”"
1086,2026-01-20 12:52:07.679,1058,"“Colors are good but I noticed at the beginning that I could see red, blue and green long rectangle squares on the left side, depending on where I move my head. I think it’s caused by fast movement from my sudden head position changes.”"
1086,2026-01-20 12:52:48.238,1099,"User is using their lap (black leggings) as a background for the display."

1086,2026-01-20 13:22:17.714,2868,"User is using the floor (dark grey carpet) to view the MR display."
1086,2026-01-20 13:27:28.051,3179,"User mentions when drinking coffee, the top of the lid being close to the lenses helped user see the display better, despite the top of the lid being white. “I could watch with the lid up close to my eye the whole time but I’m afraid it would hurt my eyes.”"
1086,2026-01-20 13:33:15.794,3527,"User says the picture of the reel is gone again. It disappeared. The video froze, user tries to scroll and it goes black. The grey outline is still present and visible but the frame where the reel should be is plain black and unresponsive."

1086,2026-01-20 13:56:22.276,4913,"“I think watching reels is easier on the phone because the image is better on the phone. To see the image on the glasses I have to look for a specific spot to make the image look less transparent.”"
1086,2026-01-20 13:57:11.111,4962,"The MR display is working but user is worried it will go out again as it has done so twice already in this session."
1086,2026-01-20 14:05:14.263,5445,"User is using the side of the dark green chair as a background to see the reels."
1086,2026-01-20 14:10:02.441,5733,"User switched gaze to a dark corner where there is shade from the tv stand."
1086,2026-01-20 14:11:02.608,5793,"User accidentally swiped up then suddenly swiped down which led to a pause/freeze in between both reels then the black screen again."

1086,2026-01-20 14:20:01.970,6333,"The reels on the phone froze. Force closing the app and reopening it fixed the problem. No network issues that we are aware of, seems to be more of a glitch within instagram."

1086,2026-01-20 14:32:33.192,7084,"A darker plain background shows the video in more detail when watching through the MR display. User preferred the tv, the dark carpet or their leg as backgrounds. User tried looking at the walls but the walls are too light."
1086,2026-01-20 14:34:10.623,7181,"User mentions shifting seats leads to head fullness/tightness. The couch felt fine but the other seats have some fullness of head while sitting there."
