1050,2025-12-17 11:05:31.005,878,"Participant notices that algorithm of Instagram reels significantly changes when watching reels on glasses vs on phone despite being connected to the same account. Glasses reels displayed more animals and “cute” content while phone displayed more comedic content"
1050,2025-12-17 11:07:19.444,987,"Participant often second guesses whether people around them can hear what they are listening to when audio is connected to glasses"
1050,2025-12-17 11:12:46.857,1314,"Participant expresses slight amusement and confusion about the difference in type of content they see while watching reels in glasses vs on the phone. Wonders why it changes significantly"
1050,2025-12-17 11:14:58.315,1446,"Participant has not noticed repeated content from glasses to phone and vice versa. I asked this question because a previous PT has reported this."
1050,2025-12-17 11:23:45.520,1973,"Participant would describe watching reels on the phone and glasses as very similar experiences, stating “after a while, you could forget that you’re watching reels on the glasses”. The only difference is that the glasses display is smaller though, not an issue to the participant."
1050,2025-12-17 11:24:58.722,2046,"Participant indicated that they would prefer watching reels against a solid background, even if it’s not necessarily a dark color. As long as it is solid, the screen contents are clear, per participant."
1050,2025-12-17 11:33:35.600,2563,"I noticed participant was moving around and stretching their body while watching reels. They appreciated the flexibility and convenience of watching reels within the glasses since the phone restricted head movements that took their line of sight away from it"
1050,2025-12-17 11:45:34.528,3282,"PT notes that the screen for the reels is fairly small but it is centered in the middle of the glasses. PT notes that they prefer to have the glasses pointed down on their face slightly because then they can look down with their head to watch (almost like watching on the phone) and that is the most comfortable head position for PT"
1050,2025-12-17 12:01:48.243,4256,"PT mentioned she likes to read comments while scrolling on instagram reels, and she is not able to do that when watching on the glasses. When asked if the glasses were preferred or the phone, they said they were 50/50 because they like the comments on the phone, but the convenience of watching on the glasses and not having to hold anything."
1050,2025-12-17 12:42:46.741,6714,"PT states the glasses do slip down when pt is looking down watching reels on the phone, but pt prefers the glasses to not be right up against their face anyways."
