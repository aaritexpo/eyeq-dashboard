1076,2025-12-18 10:01:41.940,790,"Meta asked who the pt wanted to send the message to after the pt already said the name of the person."
1076,2025-12-18 10:03:28.740,897,"Meta is cutting the pt off when trying to reply to messages in what’s app via “hey meta”"
1076,2025-12-18 10:09:20.551,1249,"Pt wishes with these gen 2 glasses that they could see the message they are saying before sending because some of the words may not be the correct word and they don’t know unless they go into the phone and check…"
1076,2025-12-18 10:12:15.170,1424,"Pt likes the voice reply while watching the videos. They say that it is convenient but wishes they could see the words meta is picking up so that they know it is correct."
1076,2025-12-18 10:12:59.324,1468,"Meta keeps stopping the video when the pt says anything, even if they haven’t said “hey meta” before talking."
1076,2025-12-18 10:18:32.782,1801,"Pt doesn’t love how it reads the whole message to them, because they’ve already read the message as it came through the notification on the phone."
1076,2025-12-18 10:22:43.167,2052,"Meta got dimensions wrong when asking the size of a poster on the wall. Poster was 12x16 meta answered 11x17"

1076,2025-12-18 10:33:16.964,2685,"Meta gave the pt a location 45 min away when asking where the closest pharmacy is…"
1076,2025-12-18 10:35:32.420,2821,"Occasionally pt doesn’t need to say hey meta before asking a question — almost as if the glasses are still waiting for a response from the previous question or still on from the answer prior…"
1076,2025-12-18 10:42:21.235,3230,"Pt was asked if the voice coming from the glasses sounds like a person or like it is coming from technology. They stated it sounds like AI but it is very smooth. The volume is good, but it is pretty monotone and doesn’t have many tone fluctuations."
1076,2025-12-18 10:47:29.551,3538,"Pt stated that it would be nice if the glasses would tell you when there is an obstruction to the camera (hair) because they didn’t know their hair was blocking it and that’s why it wasn’t working."
1076,2025-12-18 10:52:59.641,3868,"Meta was unable to audio call on WhatsApp when using “hey meta call ___”… we needed to make the initial phone call on the phone and then were able to have the call on the glasses."
1076,2025-12-18 11:01:53.801,4402,"Pt was mentioning how they haven’t been able to sleep well this week. Could be the eye strain or fatigue or something that is messing with them psychologically is what they think."
1076,2025-12-18 11:09:56.573,4885,"pt mentioned they like NOT having the neuro band because when they were wearing it, sometimes they would rotate their wrist and the volume would turn up or down when they didn’t want it to… they feel that the micro movements sometimes get in the way of the natural movements of the person."
1076,2025-12-18 11:17:07.566,5316,"Pt states that they feel less strain on their eyes wearing these gen 2 glasses compared to the other ones."
1076,2025-12-18 11:47:40.383,7149,"Meta is selective about what info it wants to give in relation to where we are. It told us where the nearest hospital is but not gas station."
