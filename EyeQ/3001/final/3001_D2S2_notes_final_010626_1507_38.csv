3001,2026-01-06 13:11:49.364,653,"YouTube is set, closed captioning is not working. Instead there will be WhatsApp messaging during the video."
3001,2026-01-06 13:14:15.500,800,"Meta Ai app could not do closed captioning because it asks user to download the English language. WhatsApp message exchange has begun while YouTube video is playing."
3001,2026-01-06 13:15:10.979,855,"While video plays on the phone, user is looking at messages through the glasses. User looks back and forth between the phone screen and the glasses display."
3001,2026-01-06 13:23:40.439,1364,"Video audio ceases when notification chime occurs from receiving a WhatsApp message. User is reading the message on the MR display."
3001,2026-01-06 13:24:18.609,1403,"Video pauses when user tells meta to reply to message. User has to unpause it to keep watching."

3001,2026-01-06 13:34:29.330,2013,"User felt that the youtube activity didn’t cause any strain because video was being watched on the phone. User wasn’t able to use captioning but feels as if it wouldn’t have added anything to the experience for them if they did work."
3001,2026-01-06 13:35:57.603,2102,"User said it didn’t take much effort going back and forth between video and messages other than occasional unpausing of the video."
3001,2026-01-06 13:37:11.733,2176,"User doesn’t believe that meta Ai provides accurate answers to questions. Ai answer gave a very unspecific and wide range to a question then provided resources to look up the answer."

3001,2026-01-06 13:44:04.956,2589,"User got meta ai to give more detail on an answer, user believes it’s due to timing of asking. If user asks while interrupting Meta, it shuts down. If user waits until meta ai is done talking, gives it a second then asks it to expand on an answer, meta Ai can."

3001,2026-01-06 13:52:36.208,3100,"User is trying to get back to seeing the videocall recipient. Struggled a bit finding it and accidentally ended the call. Calling back solved the issue."

3001,2026-01-06 14:11:23.931,4228,"User is cupping hands around the glasses lens with the display, one eye still closed to view instructions. User said it didn’t help but the thought was that user wanted to cut out the peripheral view to see the display better."
3001,2026-01-06 14:11:48.122,4252,"User wishes that the display could be blown up to view it bigger."
