3001,2026-01-05 14:01:54.685,285,"User is starting to walk around the room with glasses on to take pictures and videos. User says photos appear very small, isn’t sure how to zoom in to view photo."

3001,2026-01-05 14:03:39.233,389,"User somehow got to Spotify and can’t leave the app. Is trying to stop the music to continue taking photos."
3001,2026-01-05 14:09:21.848,732,"User says sending media manually is easier than using voice commands."
3001,2026-01-05 14:10:29.225,799,"User says using “hey meta” pops up history but user has to ask meta again in order to send media, it takes more work than sending it manually."
3001,2026-01-05 14:11:48.668,879,"User discovered the camera app. Previously used capture button and commands to take pictures."
3001,2026-01-05 14:12:29.205,919,"User says camera doesn’t have a lot of functionality compared to a phone, has limited options of what the user can do."
3001,2026-01-05 14:13:56.979,1007,"User discovered the zoom feature on the camera. “Even at max zoom, I can see it better with my normal vision than on the display at max zoom.”"
3001,2026-01-05 14:16:16.864,1147,"The display has a bit of a glare or haze around it like when you’re driving in the dark."
3001,2026-01-05 14:19:53.409,1364,"User is using photos to figure out where the camera on the glasses is. User believes it is on the left top edge of the lens."

3001,2026-01-05 14:31:16.286,2046,"User asked meta ai about gas prices in the area, meta gave an answer that is much lower than the current pricing. User doesn’t trust its answers."
3001,2026-01-05 14:32:41.077,2131,"Meta Ai said it cannot give air quality data from the past, only current or predictive. User is surprised by this answer, says even google could give an answer for this question."
3001,2026-01-05 14:36:26.338,2356,"User wants a more robust answer, not an answer that could be considered a google answer. User wants it to essentially be an AI assistant that can execute more complex tasks."
3001,2026-01-05 14:38:18.565,2469,"User is unimpressed because meta ai repeatedly asks user to consult other people for an answer or is directed to use a search engine to answer user’s questions."
3001,2026-01-05 14:41:30.189,2660,"When user speaks during the question’s answer, the entire AI answer is wiped. User can no longer see the answer, which leads them to have to re-ask the question."
3001,2026-01-05 14:44:21.352,2831,"User notes when calling up meta Ai, the blue circle appears then disappears before user can ask the question, so user has to call up Meta Ai repeatedly to get her to listen to user to ask it questions."
3001,2026-01-05 14:47:42.784,3033,"User says meta Ai will propose a follow up question with the answer, user says yes, then meta ai goes back to the main menu, never following through on the follow up it proposed to the user."

3001,2026-01-05 14:52:42.108,3332,"User says meta ai is unable to summarize a book beyond just a sentence. User wants more of a “spark notes” summarization so user can claim they’ve read the book."
3001,2026-01-05 14:53:49.433,3400,"Hey meta stopped responding to user commands. Glasses are still on. User tries manually clicking ask meta button and it is no longer responding. User is switching apps and going back to see if it will function again."

3001,2026-01-05 15:15:36.930,4707,"In case it wasn’t noted earlier, user switched to the dark green couch before starting the Spotify activity and having tech trouble. However, now there is no tech trouble after repairing glasses to the phone."
3001,2026-01-05 15:19:05.197,4915,"When user tried forwarding a fact through WhatsApp, meta reworded the answer and signed off on the text as sent from meta, rather than by the user. “Why does meta have to be involved in this when I just want to forward a fun fact?”"
3001,2026-01-05 15:23:17.633,5168,"User doesn’t like that all messages send with a period at the end of every sentence. User attempted to ask it not to send with a period and it didn’t work out."
