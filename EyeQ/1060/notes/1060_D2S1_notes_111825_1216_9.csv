1060,2025-11-18 11:57:31.622,1156,"Captions are bad. Don’t match up the words. Doubles up sometimes . Has odd pauses. Position of the captions on the phone not ideal. Is right at the center - boxed in and would not allow you see clearly. Participant has to angle their head in a weird way which is not very comfortable . Besides that the size of caption is good. It helps to position the phone further away."

It’s right in the center and boxed in - makes it difficult to watch the video. Has to position head in a weird angle to see that makes it uncomfortable. However the size of the caption is good. It appears that it’s better to hold the phone further away to watch."
