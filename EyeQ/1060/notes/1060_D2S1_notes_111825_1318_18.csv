1060,2025-11-18 11:47:06.227,531,"The subtitles (captions) sometimes don’t appear for up to 10 seconds. Then they reappear"
1060,2025-11-18 11:57:31.622,1156,"Captions are bad. Don’t match up the words. Doubles up sometimes . Has odd pauses. Position of the captions on the phone not ideal. Is right at the center - boxed in and would not allow you see clearly. Participant has to angle their head in a weird way which is not very comfortable . Besides that the size of caption is good. It helps to position the phone further away."
1060,2025-11-18 12:00:54.926,1360,"Captions are not good. Misses some words and speeds up at some point. Additionally the position of the caption on the phone is not good. It’s right in the center and boxed in - makes it difficult to watch the video. Has to position head in a weird angle to see that makes it uncomfortable. However the size of the caption is good. It appears that it’s better to hold the phone further away to watch."
1060,2025-11-18 12:03:07.442,1492,"Considers it double vision trying to watch and keep the subtitles in place."
1060,2025-11-18 12:04:53.798,1598,"Subtitles are right on the eye - so in comparison to phone position , there’s a lot of switching between sight ( near vs far)"

1060,2025-11-18 12:41:39.885,3805,"Video quality was good and sound was fine.  However the background affects how the video appears. It’s better when the is a simple flat less complex background . When we changed seats - having a more complex background had it shift in and out."
1060,2025-11-18 12:43:19.419,3904,"Pictures are clear but not when they are looking at the physical spot on the table. Has to focus image on a darker spot."
1060,2025-11-18 12:48:50.929,4236,"For the Lego task. Pictures keep timing out."
1060,2025-11-18 12:54:42.560,4587,"Lego task - participant has to look away from the work area to clearly see the pictures because of all the different colors. They were squinting a bit."
1060,2025-11-18 13:00:50.690,4955,"For the Lego task, cannot scroll through the photos in WhatsApp. The timeout is very frequent approximately 10-15s - that’s a bit frustrating."
