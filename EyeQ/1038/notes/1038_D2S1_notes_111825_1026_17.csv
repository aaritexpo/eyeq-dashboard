1038,2025-11-18 09:20:15.702,1417,"Participant expresses dislike for the live captioning feature as they feel like they have to be more conscious of head positioning since they must focus on both MR display and phone screen (head or phone must be placed in a specific position to avoid jumbled content) and neck feels strained"
1038,2025-11-18 09:21:44.255,1506,"Participant says that users might enjoy the live captioning feature more if they are unable to watch something but can still hear and see live captions in the glasses"
